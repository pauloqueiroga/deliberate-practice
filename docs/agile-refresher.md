# Agile Refresher

This is a compilation of thoughts and observations, not a course or a description of Agile or any of the specific Agile methodologies.

## Waterfall and Agile are two ends of a Spectrum, not two buckets

People like to pretend or generalize that something is either Agile or Waterfall. In my opinion, that's a misuse of both terms. Firstly, because *proper* Waterfall is extremely old, was never widely adopted, and precedes the first mentions of "Agile" by many years. When the Agile Manifesto came to be, the term "waterfall" was already being used to describe something different from that original and limited-in-adoption idea.

Steve McConnell in his ["More Effective Agile: A Roadmap for Software Leaders"](https://www.educative.io/courses/more-effective-agile-a-roadmap-for-software-leaders) highlights some of the most significant contrasts between *Sequential Development* and Agile (**emphasis** added by me):

|Sequential Development|Agile Development|
|---|---|
|Long release cycles |Short release cycles|
|Most end-to-end development work performed in large batches across long release cycles|Most end-to-end development work performed in small batches within short release cycles|
|Detailed up-front planning|**High-level up-front planning** with just-in-time detailed planning|
|Detailed up-front requirements|High-level up-front requirements with **just-in-time detailed requirements**|
|Up-front design|**Emergent design**|
|Test at the end, often as separate activity|Continuous, automated testing, integrated into development|
|Infrequent structured collaboration|Frequent **structured collaboration**|
|Overall approach is idealistic, prearranged, and control-oriented|Overall approach is empirical, responsive, and **improvement-oriented**|

My most successful experiences with Agile adoption by very different teams in distinct industries had several of those characteristics in common. Interestingly but not really too surprising, these different cases also shared some of the challenges, pitfalls and misconceptions.

Almost everyone have their eyes on the short cycles and incremental delivery of value. So I'll skip that part. Another unanimity that can be skipped is that development is not complete without continuous and automated testing as part of it and not as a separate concern. Period.

A lot of individuals read expressions such as "just-in-time" or "as little as possible" and immediately assume they mean nothing or close to nothing regarding structure, requirements, planning and forecasting. This has been the most common threat to the success of adoption that I've seen. It is no accident that Agile ideals themselves have evolved in the past twenty years and cleared out some of those initial misconceptions.

The bottom line is that both Sequential and Agile aim at achieving high-quality requirements; structured collaboration; built-in verification and acceptance gates; useful and well-applied management; etc. The successful application of Agile principles are strongly based on applying the principles and ideals that are useful for the specific cases, as well as decidedly not adopting what doesn't make sense, but being intentional and objective about both. Then, **INSPECT AND ADAPT**.
