# Judgment Experience Exercise

Most decisions are made with analysis, but some are judgment calls not susceptible to analysis due to time or information constraints. Write about a judgment call you've made recently that couldn't be analyzed. It can be a big or small one, but should focus on a business issue. What was the situation, the alternatives you considered and evaluated, and your decision making process? Be sure to explain why you chose the alternative you did relative to others considered.

Write in the style you would use to write a business whitepaper or essay.

Do not include any confidential or proprietary information from current/past employers.

Remember as you write that the reader may not be familiar with specific technical terminology, corporate cultures, and scenarios.  Use language and descriptions in your response that enable readers to fully understand the situation.
