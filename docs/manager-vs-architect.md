# Manager or Architect?

How to find out if someone will fare better as a manager-type of an architect-type? I'm often asked for advice from people trying to figure out what direction they want to steer towards in their careers...

There are a few obvious or semi-obvious ways to coach someone on finding out what their instincts and aptitudes could be, which I list below.

## People or Architecture?

This question is not about which one is better, or which one to get rid of. It's more about how does one individually feel. Are they more inclined to enjoying one subject over the other? If confronted with two distinct problems with equal importance, but one was people-related and the other was architecture-related, would they quickly pick one to tackle before the other?

## How do you feel about recruiting and interviewing?

TBD

## Are deadlines important? How so?

TBD - Predictability, consistency and measurability. Output and productivity. Refactoring and redesigning, changing minds, making it better. Just-in-time discoveries.

## If the product owner or manager or project manager wants someone or everyone to immediately drop everything and work on a new feature, what do YOU do?

TBD
