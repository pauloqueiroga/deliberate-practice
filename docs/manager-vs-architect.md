# Manager or Architect?

How to find out if someone will fare better as a manager-type of an architect-type? I'm often asked for advice from people trying to figure out what direction they want to steer towards in their careers...

There are a few obvious or semi-obvious ways to coach someone on finding out what their instincts and aptitudes could be, which I list below.

## People or Architecture?

This question is not about which one is better, or which one to get rid of. It's more about how does one individually feel. Are they more inclined to enjoying one subject over the other? If confronted with two distinct problems with equal importance, but one was people-related and the other was architecture-related, would they quickly pick one to tackle before the other?

## How do you feel about recruiting and interviewing?

This is a very important aspect of being a manager. The interview part of recruiting is also a very important aspect of being an architect, but the manager is expected to invest more time and energy in the process, scouring for the best candidates, and making sure the team is well balanced.

## Are deadlines important? How so?

Slightly experienced managers and architects will likely agree at some level that deadlines are important, or at least that they are mostly unavoidable. But for a professional who is looking to understand in which direction they want to progress, such question will likely trigger the thinking process that could lead to a more profound understanding of their own preferences.

Typically a manager will be more concerned with predictability and consistency of the team's output, regarding its quality, timeliness and compliance with the business needs. An architect may be more inclined to dig deeper into a problem or solution, and could favor more completeness and comprehensiveness over predictability and consistency.

## If the product owner or manager or project manager wants someone or everyone to immediately drop everything and work on a new feature, what do YOU do?

It is very common to hear about product managers who reach out directly to individual team members and ask them to immediately work on "something else".

## How do you feel about coaching others into becoming leaders?

A very important aspect of being a good manager or leader is the ability to delegate, inspire and coach your team members into becoming exceptional leaders themselves. I recommend anyone to always consider this aspect of the work, and start thinking about it frequently if they have never. This might be more obvious in organizations experiencing quick growth, but it is absolutely not restricted to those situations. The desire for self development and career advancement is an ubiquitous trait among engineering professionals, and both tracks require leadership skills.

## Leaders take responsibility of what happens next

TBD - Take initiative, try it, change your mind, change someone else's mind, etc.
