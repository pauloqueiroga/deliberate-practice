# Hands-on Ramp-Up with S'more

Over the past several years, while working on different software engineering teams in very different industries, I've had many team mates coming from outside of the company of from other teams. Some organizations will offer and expect a lot of structure and preparation put into the ramp-up of new hires, others will not "care" about that, and as usual, some will fall somewhere in between these two cases. What I have found in common is that very often the ramp up effort can benefit from hands-on work.

Selecting the right tasks from an existing backlog or to-do list can promote a smooth and meaningful ramp-up, keeping the new hire engaged and productive, and the team may benefit from the added capacity as well as the new hire's fresh perspective and energy.

Once you have a list of potential tasks or stories to be considered, you can use the attributes below to select which ones to assign to the new hires first. The attributes share the same level of importance and are only listed in this order because of the cheesy acronym I came up with, S'MORE: Source of knowledge, Measurable, Outsider-friendly, Relevant, Estimated.

## Source of Knowledge

A task that requires some understanding of the domain or the product to be successfully executed will likely require more time to ramp up on, but will likely be more meaningful to the new hire. This is especially true if the new hire is coming from a different industry or a different product.

As it is often the case, you should aim for some balance between too much and too little domain knowledge required to complete the task. For the sake of the ramp up, you should avoid assigning tasks that the new hire can knock out of the park based solely on their technical skills acquired somewhere else. Actually, if you find yourself in a situation where everything you can come up with is something that the new hire can do without any problem, congratulations! This is a good measure of ramp-up progress, and seems like your "new hire" is more of a veteran by now.

## Measurable

Measurable tasks are the best kinds of tasks anyway, and we should always aim to have that as an attribute of all tasks and stories, but some times it can feel like a luxury to have tasks with concrete and objective ways to measure progress and completion. If that is the case, pay special attention to this attribute when selecting tasks for the new hire, and either further refine tasks that are not yet measurable, or select other tasks that are.

## Outsider-Friendly

There could be a few different meanings to this attribute, but the one I'm referring to here is the ability for the new hire to work on the task without having to be in constant communication with other team members. This is especially important for the first few days or weeks, when the new hire is still getting to know the team and the product, and might not yet be yet comfortable enough to ask questions and seek help.
