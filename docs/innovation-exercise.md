# Innovation Experience Exercise

What is the most inventive or innovative thing you've done? It doesn't have to be something that's patented. It could be a process change, product idea, a new metric or customer facing interface â€“ something that was your idea. It cannot be anything your current or previous employer would deem confidential information. What problem were you seeking to solve? Why was it important? What was the result?

Write in the style you would use to write a business whitepaper or essay and do not use bullet points, graphics, tables, charts or flow charts.

Do not include any confidential or proprietary information from current/past employers.

Remember as you write that the reader may not be familiar with specific technical terminology, corporate cultures, and scenarios.  Use language and descriptions in your response that enable readers to fully understand the situation.
